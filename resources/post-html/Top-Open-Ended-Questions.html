/* ============================================================================================= */



Open-ended questions are incredibly valuable to the sales process (as long as you listen).

They help you gather information, qualify sales opportunities, and establish rapport, trust, and credibility.

As a sales professional, it's very important to have a repertoire of powerful open-ended questions ... questions that are answered by more than a simple yes or no ... questions where the prospect/ customer gets directly involved in the sales discussion.

<h3>The key here...</h3>
Ask the question and let the prospect/ customer give you <strong>their answer</strong>.

<strong>No leading.</strong>
<strong>No prompting.</strong>
<strong>No interrupting.</strong>

In case you've not had the opportunity to write down your open-ended favorites, here are 30 of ours. You should have several additional questions specific to your industry, but these will get you more than started.

Write down the ones you find valuable. Memorize them with your team. Practice them on your drive in or on the way to your next appointment. Print them out (<a href="#pdf-form-request">get the PDF now</a>). Post them near your phone. Pass them on to your team.

So often, it's the little things that have the greatest impact on results. Inspire a little more effort, care, and attention from your team with this 3-minute video.
