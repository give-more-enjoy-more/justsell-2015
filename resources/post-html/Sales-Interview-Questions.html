Interviewing your next sales superstar? Looking for your next sales position?

Here's a list of 51 interview questions and queries.

If you're interviewing candidates, use what you like and improve what you don't.

If you're in the hunt for a new sales position, use them as a prep tool. Work your way through and when you come out the other side ... you'll be completely tuned and ready for action.

<strong>Note to interviewers:</strong> You'd never want to use all of these questions (and certainly not in one session). Depending upon the enthusiasm, thoughtfulness, and communication style of the person you're interviewing, 5 – 10 of the most important questions to you might be all you need.

How are you investing in your current salesteam?
