Sales is rocket science.

And just as rocket science has its foundation in physical and mathematical laws and principles, sales too can be distilled into its basic fundamentals.

While branded selling systems and approaches serve several purposes (helping differentiate sales books and training material to sell them better or articulating ideas to make them easier to learn or implement), the simple fundamentals underlying all of them remain relatively unchanged.

Depending on what you sell, parts of the process may not be needed and some parts might need repeating.

Use it as a guide for the in-house sales development of your team or for your personal sales skill development (you do work on your most valuable asset, don't you?). Focus on practicing and perfecting one area each week or month. Print it out and send it out (<a href="#pdf-form-request">get the PDF now</a>). Build from it. Be more valuable.
